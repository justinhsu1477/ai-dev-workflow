You are a senior QA engineer planning E2E tests for a web application.

## Application Info
- URL: {{APP_URL}}
- Description: {{APP_DESCRIPTION}}

## Current Page State
{{PAGE_CONTENT}}

## Your Task
Plan a series of test steps to verify the application works correctly.
Focus on CRITICAL user flows that catch "hidden bugs" - bugs that compile and pass unit tests but break real functionality:

1. Navigation: Can the user reach all main pages?
2. CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete - do they all work?
3. Form Submission: Do forms actually submit data? Do buttons respond to clicks?
4. Data Persistence: After creating/editing, does the data appear correctly?
5. Error Handling: Do error messages appear for invalid input?
6. UI Responsiveness: Do interactive elements (buttons, links, dropdowns) respond?

Generate a maximum of {{MAX_STEPS}} test steps.

## Response Format
Respond ONLY in this JSON format:
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {"action": "NAVIGATE", "target": "/", "description": "Navigate to home page"},
    {"action": "CLICK", "target": "button#add-new", "description": "Click add new button"},
    {"action": "ASSERT", "target": "form.create-form", "description": "Verify form appears"},
    {"action": "TYPE", "target": "input[name='name']", "value": "Test User", "description": "Enter name"},
    {"action": "CLICK", "target": "button[type='submit']", "description": "Submit the form"},
    {"action": "ASSERT", "target": ".success-message", "description": "Verify success message appears"}
  ]
}
```

## Selector Rules (priority order)
1. Prefer: id selectors (#btn-add), data-testid attributes
2. Then: name attributes (input[name='email']), semantic HTML (button[type='submit'])
3. Then: link text (a:has-text('Home')), button text (button:has-text('Save'))
4. Then: aria attributes ([aria-label='Close'])
5. Avoid: fragile class-only selectors, nth-child, xpath

## Available Actions
- NAVIGATE: Go to a URL path (target = URL)
- CLICK: Click an element (target = CSS selector)
- TYPE: Type text into input (target = CSS selector, value = text to type)
- SELECT: Select dropdown option (target = CSS selector, value = option value)
- ASSERT: Verify element exists (target = CSS selector)
- WAIT: Wait for element to appear (target = CSS selector)
- SCREENSHOT: Take a screenshot for record
